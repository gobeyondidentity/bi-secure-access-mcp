The response will only contain identities matching the filter in the
request. If no filter is provided, the request will match all identities in
the realm. Currently, the only supported filter is
\`traits.username eq "$USERNAME"\`.

The response will contain at most 200 items and may contain a page token to
query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
contain 20 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of identities in
the response. Note that the maximum and default page sizes are subject to
change.

When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
overridden on subsequent requests. The filter is also maintained by the page
token but it may not be overridden. If specified, the request filter must
match the filter maintained by the page token, otherwise you will receive a
400 error. The skip is not maintained by the page token and must be
specified on each subsequent request.

Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
token will result in undefined behavior.

The Beyond Identity SCIM server also does not support modifying both a
group and its membership in the same operation. For example, a PATCH
request to update a group's display name and its membership should specify
two separate operations, one to update the display name and the other to
modify the membership.

Currently, "replace" operations are supported for displayName while "add"
and "remove" operations are supported for members. Multiple members may be
added at a time, but batch remove is not supported. Note that while member
changes will take affect, they will not be reflected in the response
as members are not currently returned with groups.
